        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Pots de Crème</h4>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>4 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate (62% cacao), broken into small pieces</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon red gel food coloring, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cream cheese</li>

            <h4>Whipped Topping (optional)</h4>
            <li>1/4 cup very cold heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For pots de crème, whisk together milk, cream, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly with a spatula over medium heat, until the mixture is hot and steamy, but has not begun to simmer yet. An instant read thermometer inserted into the mixture should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, add chocolate, and swirl pan a few times to settle chocolate down. Let sit for 2 minutes. Add salt, vanilla, and red coloring. </li>
            <li>After 2 minutes, add cream cheese, and whisk everything until smooth. If cream cheese is not mixing in completely, use a stick blender to mix for a few seconds. </li>
            <li>Transfer mixture into serving glasses or jars. Place jars on a tray and tap each one gently a few times to bring any air bubbles to the surface. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until cold and firm, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>For whipped topping, add heavy cream, confectioner’s sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla to a bowl, and whisk until medium-stiff peaks form. Add to a piping bag, and pipe (or spoon) over chilled pots de crème. Dust lightly with cocoa powder, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
